            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Many different versions of this rich bread, laced with rum syrup and drizzled with icing, are served at Easter in Polish households.
            It's such a tradition, and so well-loved, that there are probably as many babka recipes as there are Polish bakers!</p>
            <p>This particular recipe was inspired by one in our 1990 200th Anniversary Cookbook, which includes a wealth of recipes and information from cultures around the world.
            You'll notice that, despite being made with yeast, it's an easy batter bread; "no-knead" isn't as new a concept as you might think.</p>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <li>Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Place everything except the fruit in a mixing bowl, and beat at medium speed until cohesive. Increase your mixer's speed to high, and beat for <strong>2 minutes</strong>.</li>
                <li>Add the fruit, beating gently just to combine.</li>
                <li>Cover the bowl, and let the dough/thick batter rest/rise for <strong>60 minutes</strong>; it won't appear to do too much.</li>
                <li>Scoop the batter into a greased <em>10-cup Bundt pan</em>. Cover the pan, and let the dough rest/rise for <strong>30 minutes</strong>, while you preheat your oven to <strong>350째F / 180째C</strong>.</li>
                <li>Bake the babka for <strong>35 to 40 minutes</strong>, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf reads at least <strong>190째F / 90째C</strong>.</li>
                <li>While the babka is baking, prepare the rum syrup. Combine all of the syrup ingredients in a small saucepan set over medium heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, and boil, swirling the liquid in the pan, until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat.</li>
                <li>Remove the babka from the oven. Poke it all over gently with a toothpick or fork, and slowly pour the syrup over the babka's surface.</li>
                <li>When the syrup is fully absorbed (about 20 minutes or so), carefully loosen the babka's edges, and turn it out of the pan onto a rack.</li>
                <li>If you choose to use the <strong>icing</strong>: Mix all of the ingredients together, stirring until smooth. Drizzle over completely cool babka.</li>
