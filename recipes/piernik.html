        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Piernik is a Polish gingerbread or honey spice cake that is packed with delicious flavor. It's traditional for the festive season, but being both easy and tasty, it's worth making any excuse to make it.</p>
        <p>The name comes from "pierna" meaning spices in old Polish. It typically refers to a Polish spiced cake, but just as gingerbread can refer to both a cake and gingerbread cookies, piernik can as well.</p>
        <p>The town of Toruń is very famous for their gingerbread, made there since Medieval times. Traditionally they are made in moulds, so more of a cookie.</p>
        <p>Piernik has been made since the 12th century, with the original being simply flour, honey and spices. In many cases, pierniczki is the name for the gingerbread cookies while, but not strictly so, as in the case of the Toruń version.</p>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <li>Preheat the oven to <strong>355°F / <em>180°C</em></strong>. Lightly butter a 9x5in (23x13cm) loaf tin (8 ½ x 4 ½in/ 21x11cm also works) then line it with parchment, at least through the bottom and up longer sides.</li>
            <li>Put the honey, sugar, butter, orange zest and marmalade or jam in a small pan. Warm them together over a medium-low heat until the butter and sugar dissolve. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Mix together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and spices in a large bowl. Lightly beat the eggs. Add the honey-butter mixture, milk and eggs to the flour mixture and mix so they are well combined but try not to over-mix.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into the lined loaf pan and transfer to the oven (lower middle shelf). Bake for around <strong>50 minutes</strong> until the top is golden and a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Allow the loaf to cool slightly, then mix together the frosting. Sift the powdered sugar into a small bowl and add the cocoa powder. Melt the butter then add this and the boiling water to the sugar and mix well. Spread over the top of the loaf evenly, but try not to over-work it. Ideally leave it to harden before taking the loaf from the pan and slicing, but it will be fine if you do while still slightly warm.</li>
